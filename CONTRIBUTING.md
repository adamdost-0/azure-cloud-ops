# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Quick guidelines
- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes.
- Prefer small, focused PRs.
- Keep docs links working (GitHub + Pages) and avoid breaking the site build.

## Security
If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please avoid public disclosure. Open a private report if possible.
