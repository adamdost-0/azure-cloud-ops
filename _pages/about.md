## Who I am

I’m Adam Dost. I build practical Azure platforms with an emphasis on infrastructure-as-code, networking, and security guardrails. I’m a **Microsoft Principal Architect**, focused on helping teams ship reliable systems, reduce operational toil, and make changes safely.

My specialty is building **production-ready Azure platforms** with **guardrails-first governance** (policy, security, and reliability controls) so teams can move fast without creating risk.

## What I’m good at

- **AI & automation:** AI-enabled solutions, workflow automation, productivity tooling
- **Networking & platform architecture:** hub-spoke, private endpoints, DNS, firewall patterns, secure connectivity
- **Automation / IaC:** repeatable deployments, environment standardization, CI/CD guardrails
- **Governance & security-by-default:** policy-as-code, compliance-aligned design, reducing drift and insecure defaults

## What this site is

This repo backs my blog and portfolio. You’ll find:

- posts explaining architecture decisions and tradeoffs
- runnable examples (when practical)
- diagrams and reference implementations

If you’re a recruiter or hiring manager, start with **Projects** and **Contact**.
