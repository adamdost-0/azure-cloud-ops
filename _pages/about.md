I'm a Sr. Cloud Solution's Architect at @microsoft.

I have worked in large and small Azure  Enterprise Environment's in various Azure Regions and architected various enviornments inside of them.  The two areas of Cloud I will always recommend individuals focus on first is **Networking** and **Identity**. These two core areas are the driving factor for a secure longterm cloud adoption.

When I'm not at my machine I spend my free time playing the fun uncle and entertaining my two amazing nephews. I enjoy browsing reddit and engaging with other professionals over at [r/Azure](https://reddit.com/r/Azure) and [r/SysAdmin](https://reddit.com/r/SysAdmin) to help understand what others in the field are working through and learn vicariously from others mistakes.

My opinions are of my own and do not represent my employer. If you'd like to speak with me then send me a GitHub Message!
