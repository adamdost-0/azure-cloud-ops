## Emulating On-Prem scenarios in Azure

As more companies look to migrate to the Cloud in phases they need to ensure connectivity between their new environment's stays within their current security boundries. With Azure VPN Gateway's we can do an initial VNET2VNET Connection to emulate how that *could* look like and test out certain configuration's here before transferring them to a production environment.

## Resources we will be using

* Virtual Networks
* Network Interface Cards
* Virtual Network Gateway's
* Public IP addresses
* Virtual Machine's (Only when we're ready!)
